Hi there! I'm wise, a student at Takoradi Technical University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. As an aspiring software engineer, I'm constantly learning new skills and technologies to help me achieve my goals. On this GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of my school projects,<!-- including [List some of your best projects and their descriptions] -->. I also have a main account where I work on personal projects and contribute to open-source projects ([Link to your main account]). I'm always looking for feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to reach out and connect with me!
